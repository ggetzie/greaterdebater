  <h2>Privacy policy</h2>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>
    This site collects no more data about you than most other websites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Any information submitted to the site for public consumption is
    published and except in very limited circumstances, will be a
    permanent part of this site. If you decide to post comments,
    links, or any other information you must keep this in mind.    
  </p>
  <p>
    This privacy policy will be reviewed, and may be revised, from time
    to time. You may wish to revisit it regularly.
  </p>

  <h3>Public data and publishing</h3>
  <p>
    Browsing this site doesn’t reveal your identity publicly, though
    see Private Logging later in this document for more information.
  </p>

  <h3>Author identification</h3>

  <p>
    When creating an account, a name and email address are required. You
    do not have to select your real name. Your email address will not be
    published.
  </p>

  <h3>Cookies for registered users</h3>
  <p>
    The software running this site uses cookies if you create an
    account.  This is a convenience for you so that you do not need to
    type in the same information the next time you visit.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may wish to clear these cookies and the browser cache if you
    wish to refrain from revealing any identifying information,
    especially if you are using a public or shared computer.
  </p>

  <h3>Private logging</h3>
  
  <p>
    Any time you visit a page on the internet, you send quite a bit of
    information to the server. The webservers that host this site
    maintain access logs with the information that you send. This
    information is used to provide site statistics and to get an idea of
    popular pages and what sites link here. We do not intend to use
    these logs to identify legitimate users.
  </p>
  <p>
    The data logged may be used by us to solve technical problems with
    the site and, in cases of abuse of this site, to investigate the
    abuse.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are concerned about attempts to match your IP address to
    your identity, you may wish to use an anonymous browsing service
    or attempt some means to obfuscate your real IP address.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    If so, you might like to try Tor, an anonymous browsing
    service. Please
    see <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">http://tor.eff.org/</a> for more
    details.
  </p>

  <h3>Data release policy</h3>
  
  <p>
    Our policy is to only release the data we collect in the following
    circumstances:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      As required by law, such as in response to a valid request
      from law enforcement.
    </li>
    <li>
      To designated third parties to resolve or investigate abuse
      complaints.
    </li>
    <li>
      When the information is related to spiders or bots, usually
      when investigating technical issues.
    </li>      
    <li>
      For abusive users, we may release information to assist in
      attempting to block the abusive user or to complain to that user’
      s Internet Service Provider.
    </li>
    <li>
      If necessary to defend legal claims against us by third
      parties.
    </li>
    <li>
      When we deem it necessary to protect the property or rights of
      the user community, or this website.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Information security</h3>

  <p>
    We make no guarantee that the information that you provide us will
    be secure.
  </p>

  <h3>Email</h3>
  <p>
    You are required to give your email address when you create an
    account. This email address will not be published. This email
    address will not be sold to any third party.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are concerned, you may wish to get a free email account or
    attempt to use a remail service, or use a fake email address as no
    attempt is made to validate it, other than ensuring it is in the
    form of an email address. However, a valid email is required if
    you wish to reset your account password.
