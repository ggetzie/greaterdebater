How a draw should work:
You can offer a draw only when it's your turn.
You submit a comment explaining why you want a draw.
Offering a draw uses your turn.
Responding to a draw offer also uses your turn.
Response requires a comment as well.
An offer of a draw must be declined before an argument can continue.

	 	    	    	 	     User B accepts, (status: Arg over, draw)
User A offers draw (status: User B's turn) <
       	      	          	      	     User B rejects, posts reply to A's reasoning (status: User A's turn)
