My website http://greaterdebater.com has been up and running for a few
months now.  It's a social news and debate site largely inspired by
reddit. In addition to sharing links and commenting on them, you can
also challenge other users to one-on-one debates which take place in a
special thread where only you and your opponent can post. Other users
can view the debate and vote for the winner.  Currently I'm working on
a blog to (hopefully) market the site better and attract some more
users besides myself and a few of my friends.
